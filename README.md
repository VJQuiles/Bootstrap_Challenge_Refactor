# Lab 3 Developing with Bootstrap

At first, I had issues drawing correlation between CSS styling, and what we learned in bootstrap. Part of it was that i was too worried about structure, meaning that I thought things had to be ordered in a class a particular way or it wouldn't work. ANother challenege that stuck, and took the longest to overcome, was getting the hover effects in the blog card. That taught me about styling being overwritten and the use of !important to troubleshoot and find where the issues are. 

Once I got the hang of what I was doing, and better saw the correlation, it made it much easier to go through and style, particularly keeping track of what you were styling. You also didn't have to denote as many styling commands as with CSS. 

In what I experienced in this lab, it might be chosen when you want specficity. As much as bootstrap streamlines the styling process, you don't have as much power to really fine tune little details. I can see a little more now of what Tishana meant when she said it caused a bit of uniformity amongst the design of webpages.
